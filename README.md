# bikeStoreProject-Public
First attempt at a website

This was a project that myself and about 7 other classmates worked on. It is essentially our first expeirence building a website
We did this in our software engineering class with the mentorship of our proffesor. We all took turns working on the front end
and back end. So we all worked on a little bit of every part of the website. However, I worked on the front end part the most.
